# Project Offline [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/andrewtyl/project-offline.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/andrewtyl/project-offline)
## Andrew Jessen-Tyler

This is just a simple React App I made to use when one of my projects is offline, but I want to keep the subdomain reserved and advise people who visit it. <br/> This was made from my "react-boilerplate" template, which you can find [here](https://github.com/andrewtyl/react-boilerplate).

### Scripts
* `npm start` - starts the react server locally
* `npm test` - runs all test files
* `npm run build` - creates a build of the web app for deployment
* `npm run predeploy` - Updates the package-lock.json to match values on package.json, creates a build of the web app for deployment, and runs a server of the build locally
